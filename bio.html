	<h1>Shriya Nevatia</h1>
	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>I am a member of the Class of 2014 from Queensbury, New York. 
	I am majoring in Mathematics & Computer Science and minoring in 
	Entrepreneurial Leadership. Beyond my academic work, I have 
	practiced various styles of dance (including Classical Indian 
	Bharatnatyam, Bollywood, Ballet, Jazz, and Tap) since age 3. In 
	high school, I was involved in music and visual art, along 
	with educational activities including tutoring and leading 
	workshops. I taught a classical Indian Dance class following 
	the completion of my graduation performance, called an Arangetram.

	In the summer of 2011, I taught middle school science with 
	Breakthrough Cambridge for 8 weeks. In the summer of 2012, I was 
	in Project Breaker, a design thinking and social entrepreneurship 
	challenge founded by TED fellow Juliette LaMontagne. At Tufts, I 
	am on the Tamasha fusion dance team and Tufts Association of South 
	Asians executive board. In the fall of my freshmen year, I was 
	Assistant Choreographer for the Over the Rainbow 2010 production. 
	I was also Art Director for the 2011 TASA Culture Show and logo 
	designer for the 2012 TASA Culture Show. I am currently a tour 
	guide for Undergraduate Admissions. I am working on breaking
	in to the Boston Startup scene and picking up design, business, 
	and web development skills in this quest. I would like to work
	in Educational Technology after graduation and be an Education 
	Entrepreneur.</p>
