	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>I am a 21 year old undergraduate student at Tufts University studying Math and Computer Science. I grew up in Queensbury, New York. At Tufts I have been a member of the Tufts Community Union Senate, Tufts Tamasha dance team, and Synaptic Scholars in the Institute for Global Leadership. I founded The Violet Society in October 2013.

	I am enthralled with Educational Technology and Design. My favorite sites to keep track of Ed Tech trends are Hack Education, Ed Surge, and Mind/Shift. Other sites I love include Hacker News, Jezebel, TechCrunch, and Fast Company Design. I love Twitter and Quora. I love reading magazines (like Wired and New York), dancing (Bollywood, Hip Hop, and Jazz are my favorites), writing (on Medium), watching TV (favorite shows include Community and Arrested Development), and cooking (I love Artichokes and Arugula).</p>
