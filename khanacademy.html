            <h2>I love Khan Academy!</h2>
            My dream is to help people around the world learn and grow throughout their lives, and use their knowledge to create wonderful and beautiful things together that solve global problems.
            <br>
            <br>
            Khan Academy has changed my life in so many ways since I first created found the website 3+ years ago. It is my dream to work at a company that is positively impacting the lives of so many people.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>How I have demonstrated my passion for KA:</h2>
            I have read Sal's book and fell in love with the current mission of Khan Academy and its ever-growing potential to transform education.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have helped countless students (at Breakthrough and through volunteer tutoring local high school students while at Tufts) use Khan Academy's resources to help them with Mathematics and show them how much there is to learn if they are curious. 
            <br>
            <br>
            This past winter I showed Khan Academy to my nephew Varun (who is 8 years old) in Indore, India. He's very bright but typically so energetic that he can't sit still for 5 minutes. When I showed him Khan Academy math exercises, he sat still for 45 minutes and kept working on exercises until he reached material he hadn't learned yet in school-- and he wanted me to teach him how to do it right there! I was overjoyed and excited about what he could learn if he kept working, so my cousins are helping him work on the site more often and I have made myself his coach on the site.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>Why you should hire me:</h2>
            I live and breathe Education, Programming, and Design. I'm reading Don't Make Me Think and I follow the work of Bret Victor religiously. I keep up-to-date with EdTech by reading Hack Education, EdSurge, and Mind/Shift. I also frequent Hacker News and Fast Company Design to stay up-to-date with the worlds of Programming and Design. Perhaps you've noticed that this website uses the same color scheme as the website! :)
            <br>
            <br>
            I have already started brainstorming improvements to the design of the Khan Academy website and mobile app. One thing that has stood out to me most is the design of math exercises; the box that floats in front of the background page is not very responsive, and the drag-and-drop categorization exercises run off the bottom of the screen when the page takes up the full screen in Chrome on a Macbook. I even used the Khan Academy website for an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HBqkfZeGOZ0iVfnvbkVehjG2pgu5g8AtcKvAQ5lkWLo/pub">assignment in my HCI Class</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I am a well-qualified undergraduate student, like everyone else applying for Khan Academy internships, but unlike most of them I am also a frequent user of the site. I made it my mission to complete all the Mathematics exercises on the site at various points in the past few years, but you're all just too good--every time I got close to finishing up, 50-100 more exercises went live! Although I was disheartened to realize I wouldn't be "Done", I was overjoyed to see the scope of the platform become wider and deeper. At least in my quest to conquer the exercises <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/shriyanevatia/">I have racked up over 2.5 million points!</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            I've been spreading the word about Khan Academy since its early days and have seen the site transform into the gorgeous and robust product it is today. I've been following the growth of KA for years and recently have read about it on Quora and Hacker News to find out everything I could, and talked to your former intern Jessica at Hack@Brown this January. I know there are lots of people who are very passionate about Khan Academy but I am definitely up there!!

                    Summer 2013 <br>
                    <br>
                    I helped Prof. Ben Shapiro at the Tufts CEEO for half of the summer as a UX designer working on Trails Forward, a educational video game that helps students learn about the environment, and Blocky Talky, a new visual programming language to be used with small robots run with a BrickPi. I utilized the techniques I had learned at General Assembly's UX Design course the previous Spring to help the team design the following aspects of both products: Information Architecture, User Analysis, Wireframes, and Feature Analysis. I also gained experience with iMovie and put together a video summarizing user tests previously conducted with an early version of Trails Forward. This experience helped me understand the value of good UX design because things that I assumed were obvious to everyone designing or building the platforms were not necessarily so.

                    Summer 2012 <br>
                    <br>
                    I spent the summer in New York City taking classes at NYU and Columbia, and over the weekend Project Breaker was an inspiring and eye-opening experience. My fellow Breakers and I learned and explored under the tutelage of Juliette LaMontagne, diving deep into all stages of Design Thinking to create business plans and product designs. We were faced with the challenge of utilizing Technology to encourage Civic Engagement in communities, and in the process we were able to meet a variety of accomplished individuals and tour various company offices. The first time I saw Frog Design, I could hardly contain how excited I was. Before Breaker, I hadn't realized that Design &amp; Technology is the field I have been looking for my entire life-- a perfect intersection of everything I have been passionate about for my entire life: creating art, using mathematics &amp; data, utilizing technology &amp; computer science, and interacting with people to help them solve their problems.

                    Summer 2011 <br>
                    <br>
                    I taught Genetics and Writing to 7th &amp; 8th grade students in one of the the most challenging and rewarding experiences in my life. I taught full-time in the summer at Breakthrough Cambridge and continued that Fall teaching at the after-school program every week. Breakthrough was inspiring, immensely challenging, and all-consuming. This summer instilled in me an even greater respect for teaching and education than I had prior to Breakthrough, and it cemented my interest in Education forever. The students I worked with taught me so much every day, and my fellow teachers were some of the most dedicated, creative, and hard-working people I have ever met. I was the campus recruiter at Tufts in 2011-2012 because I wanted to spread the word about this amazing non-profit organization that was transforming the lives of middle school students and college-aged teachers.
